                    <p>Passengers travelling to Mauritius will have to fulfil all travel exigencies before their flight. 
                        All passengers travelling to Mauritius must possess the following documents:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>A valid air ticket to Mauritius. It is important that you provide your email address and mobile number for us to communicate with you.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Prior to travel, it is recommended for all travelers to fill out the digital <b>ALL IN ONE FORM</b>. It will generate a PDF document with a QR Code, which must be presented to Health Officials on arrival at Mauritius Airport. At the moment, you also need to fill out the Immigration Disembarkation Card, which will be handed to you during your flight to Mauritius. Please submit this to the Immigration Officials on arrival at Mauritius Airport.</p></li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><b>Please check whether you are required to meet other requirements as imposed by your country of departure for travelling to Mauritius.</b></p>
                    <p>All passengers arriving from France must meet the travel requirements that may be imposed by the French Government listed on the French Ministry of Interior website: <a href="https://www.interieur.gouv.fr/covid-19-international-travel#from4a">https://www.interieur.gouv.fr/covid-19-international-travel#from4a</a>.</p>
                    <p>A check of the supporting documents, if required, will be made in France before departure. Please note that this does not apply to passengers in transit at Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport.</p>
